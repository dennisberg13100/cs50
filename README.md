# Introduction to Computer Science

## Week 0

Project in [scrath](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Scratch is a website from MIT where you can put "Blocks of code" together. An amazing way to understand what programing is on a funny and interactive way. In this week our problem set (exercices, that we called pset) was just to create a simple program puting some of this "blocks of code" together.

## Week 1

Program in C. This first week we had to create a program that draw a piramid with a loop, and that the user could choose the size from the loop. We also had to creat a greedy program, that checks wat is the minimum number of coins that we can use to give back some exange. This to exercise are not availible anymore because it was created in a Sandbox, and not included in this repository, but we recreated this exercise in python in pset6.

## Week 2

In this week we learned what arrays are and how we can manipulate them. The exercises from this week were to create a sistem than encode a text on a very simple way, just adding number (chosen by yhe user) to the characters, so if the chosen number was 2, the letter a  would be c, b would be d en so on. On the other exercise we had to creat a program that could take a text as an input and could tell us the difficulty level to read this text base on the [Coleman-Liau index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index). This exercises are availible in the pset2 folder in this repository.

## Week 3

In this week we learned about alogriths and as exercise we had to create to different voting sistems, and both of them are available in the folder pset 3 from this repository. The difference between the two voting sistems is that runoff has a more fare way to check who won in case of a tie.

## Week 4

In this week we started to learn about memory and here the problems started to get really challenging. In the first problem we created da program that creat filters for fotos (gray-scale, miror-rotation, blur and edge detection) in C. The second program should recover lost pictures in a foto camera memory. Both of this exercises are also available in this repository in the pset4 folder.

## Week 5

Here we learned about data-structure and we srarted do learn how to handle bigger data (then just the arrays until now). In this exercise we had to create speller check program, this program would have a input file "book" and a input file "dictionaty". This program would check for each word in the book if its in the dictionary, otherwise, tell us that this word was spelled wrong. It was very important in this exercise that the program could realise this work in less time as possible (this program also pronted out how long it took to check every thing). Also available in Pset 5.

## Week 6

Here we started to program in phyton. The first exercise was to re-write part of oure exercises made in C in Python. The other exercise was to write a program that would take a file with DNA code and tell use to who it belongs. Both exercises are available in the pset6 folder.

## Week 7

In this week we started to use SQL programing language and we learned about data-base. The exercises from this week were to create a lot of SQL request from a movie data base (13 in total) and the other was to convert a data-base that was writen in a csv (coma separated values), is a SQLite3 database to improve speed and eficiens to oure data-base.

## Week 8

Here we had oure last general lesson, and we talked a little bit about the risk of abstraction. From here on we had to chose our path. I chose the Web path. This path has 2 exercises, one for the front-end (html, css, and javaScript), in which we had to create a page telling about oure self. This page is available here in the pset8 folder and also online. [CLICK HERE OT VISIT THE SITE](https://dennisberg13100.github.io/homepage-CS50/).The second exercise was a kind of a game. In this game you start with $ 10,000.00 and you can buy and sell stock-markt shares to try to get more money. This exercise is available on the finance folder in this repository, and I have still plans to put it online aswell.

## Final Project

For our final project we could chose what ever we whanted to program with any of the languages that we learned. I created a Front-end Sandbox. A website in which you van run some testcodes in HTML, CSS an JavaScript and see the results on real time on the same screen.
